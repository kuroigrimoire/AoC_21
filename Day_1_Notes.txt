Advent of Code

Day 1 - Sensor Sweep

Pseudocode

Read in an array of numbers. The numbers represent the depth in front of the submarine.
Determine whether the depth increases or decreases and you move through the list of numbers (the submarine moves forward).

declare an array of numbers and provide the numbers given. 
-    for example 10 numbers are given. array has a length of 10
input was provided in the form of a text file.
-    read in text from the text file and store into a string. 
-    convert the string to an integer value using stoi and then add to vector of measurements.
declare 2 integer variables and initialize them to 0.
-    the first stores the number of increases, the second stores for decreases.
start with the second number (number in position 1), determine the difference between it and the previous, 
-    if positive increment the increase, if negative, increment Decreases.
determine which value is larger. 
print to screen.
