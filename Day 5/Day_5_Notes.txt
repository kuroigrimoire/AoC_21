read in the text file.

file is a list of 2 points indicating a starting point and ending point.
place text into a vector of strings.

create unordered map container

run each string through a function which splits into the 4 components which make up the ending and starting positions
     function starts by using a delimeter string to split the original into 2.
     then the 2 halves are run through another function which use a second delimeter to split the strings further 
          into the 2 components of each point.

     take the X and Y coordinates and label them as starting and end points.
     override the subtraction operator to determine the direction and movement that is needed to be made.
          determine is either the X values are the same, or the Y values are the same.
          For part 2, subtract either way and determine fi the differences are the same value.
     TEST CASE PRIOR TO MAKING MAP: print out the distance which is required and the direction that is needed to move.
     
     ACTUAL: after finding the movement and the direction
          from the starting point, check to see if it is in the map.
               if it is not in the map, add it and key 1
               if it is already present, increment its current value.
               
               take necessary difference and direction and print result as a pair.
               check the difference and increment until the desired number of spaces has been moved
               for each step, create a new point, repeat steps above for adding/incrementing
     
create an unordered map

check to verify that the first point transitions tot he second horizontally or vertically.
