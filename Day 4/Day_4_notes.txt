Day 4 - Sanity Check

Purpose: read in a txt file and use it to play a game of bingo. 
The first line is th numbers that will be called in the game.
The following lines represent the bingo boards being used. The lines are in 5 x 5 grids.
 Start by opening the file. fstream variable was declared with the file name.
 -   check to see that the file was opened successfully.
 Once opened, the file ir read into a vector of strings, using the getline function.
 Contents of the file can then be manipulated easier.
 The first line is tehn extracted from the vector and placed into a vector of integers.
 -   a sstram function is used to read in the first line
 -   the getline function then uses the stream, a string variable and the desried delimeter
     in order to parse through. 
-    the contents are stored in the string temporarily before they are then added to a vector of integers
     using both the push_back function and the stoi function.
The first two lines of the input vector are removed as we are done with them. 
This lets us focus on the inputs for the bingo board.
Declare object of class BingoBoard.
